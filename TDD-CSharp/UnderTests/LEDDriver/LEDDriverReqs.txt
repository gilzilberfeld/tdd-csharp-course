The LED driver controls 16 two-state LEDs.
The driver can turn on or off individual LED without affecting others.
The driver can turn all LEDs on or off with a single interface call.
The user of the driver can query the state of any LED.
At power-on, the LEDs must be turned off by the software.
The LEDs are memory mapped to a 16-bit word (at an address to be determined).
A 1 in a bit position lights the corresponding LED; 0 turns it off.
The least significant bit corresponds to LED 1; the most significant bit corresponds to LED 16.
