The calculator has a display area, which is updated as the keys are pressed.
The calculator has a keypad with digits (0-9), operations (+,-,*,/), a C clear button and an ‘=‘ button to execute the calculation.
Any other key pressed doesn’t affect the display.

Pressing any digit, the display adds that digit to existing display. The exception is ‘0’ which is presented only if a number different than ‘0’ wasn’t already pressed.
Pressing an operation key does not change the display.
Pressing “C” resets the calculator.
Pressing “=” shows the calculation result. There are no intermittent results shown until it is pressed.
